US_traffic_fatalities
=====================

This project was originally forked from sjmgarnier.

The original data was not normalized by population and led to some very misleading results as states with large population growth from 1970-2010 appeared to have an increasing fatality rate. However fatalities per 100K people has actually decreased across all states.
